# DailyIntegral

Welcome to DailyIntegral, a website that gives users a new integral to solve every day. Whether youâ€™re sharpening your calculus skills or just love solving integrals for fun, you can challenge yourself daily and even catch up on past problems if you miss a day. <br><br>
âœ… Instant grading â€“ Enter your answer, and the site will check if itâ€™s correct. <br>
ðŸ“– Step-by-step solutions â€“ After the dayâ€™s problem expires, you can see how to solve it (when available). <br>
ðŸ”¥ Streaks & leaderboards â€“ Keep track of your longest solving streak and compete with others. <br>
ðŸ‘¤ Profiles â€“ Track your progress, see your personal solving history, and check out other users' profiles. <br>
<br>
Building this was a fun challengeâ€”collecting integral data using LaTeX OCR, cleaning and validating it, setting up a reliable answer validator powered by Mathematica, and effectively managing user data. <br>
